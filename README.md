# StarryNight

A Simple application built with the purpose of showing details about a pre fabricated list of Stars fetched from a JSON file.
The goal of this application is to be light weight and show information provided from the JSON file and other sources (wikipedia).

The star detail page lists all the properties provide in the json file and expands on that by pulling commonly shared data points 
on wikipedia between the 5 stars (Born and Occupation).
