# StarryNight

A Simple application built with the purpose of showing details about a pre fabricated list of Stars fetched from a JSON file.
The goal of this application is to be light weight and show information provided from the JSON file and other sources (wikipedia).

Requirements:
- Use RecyclerView
- Show loading progress bar
- Format the list 2 person per row on phone (single person per row format for tablet)
- Clickable cards to show Details 
- Stylize Star badge based on badgeColour from the JSON list
- Follow material design

Bonus: 
- Added 2 extra fields in the Detail section (Born and Occupation) with data scrape from Wikipedia
- Design the app to be adaptable for Phone + Tablet (shared code base)

The star detail page lists all the properties provide in the json file and expands on that by pulling commonly shared data points 
on wikipedia between the 5 stars (Born and Occupation).
